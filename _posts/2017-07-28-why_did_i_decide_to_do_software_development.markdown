After being in my field for 12 years, I began feeling tired. I began to think that I know everything there is to know. While I know that's not true, I still had that feeling. I had a lot of recruiters calling me, so I decided to start exploring if making a change was the right thing for me. Every time I talked to a company, it sounded so familiar. Every place was so simliar to what I did, but had their own spin. Nothing seemed challenging enough that it would be worth the jump. I was afraid that a few months after starting a new job, I would just be back in the same spot. Even with the offers of a nice finanical bump, I couldn't convince myself it was a good decision.

My love for learning never stops. I have a bachelors, masters, and doctorate. So, I began to think that I need a change for the better. One that would excite me and I was ready to learn something new. I did not want to just change careers to change. So, I started to reflect on what I enjoyed. When I first received my bachelors, I worked in the IT world. It was something I really enjoyed, but a few years later I relocated and I was presented with a great job oppounity outside the field. Since then, I never went back. However, I love working with computers. Finding an issue and just working towards it until I have a solution. It's exciting to me and I love problem solving. So, as I was reflecting over a few months of what I wanted to do, I kept coming back to software development. I had thought about it a lot and I knew I was making a good decision to dive in and move forward with gaining new skills for an exciting career ahead.
