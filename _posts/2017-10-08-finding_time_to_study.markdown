Lately, I've been finding it hard to study. Life has pulled me in a lot of directions and at the end of the day, it's hard to look at the computer any longer. I work full-time and my full-time job often is more than 40 hours. Then, I teach for an university. To make things harder, I'm in the middle of moving. Finding a place to live, putting my house up for sale, working with contractors to do some touching up of the house, and packing takes up a lot of my time. However, in a few weeks a lot of that, besides working and teaching, will go away. I have been reflecting on this today and know I need put a plan in place. I have put a plan in place to wear I will be studying once I get into my new place. In addition, I have setup goals for the next few weeks which are not as aggressive, but will ensure I make progress. Rather than go days without working.
